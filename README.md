## Projects

If You Have A Project You Would Like To Add, Create That Project In The [Project](projects) Folder.  
There Is Also An Examples Folder Just In Case You Might Need To Learn Something Or Want To Know How Something Works

Your Game Or Programm Can Be In Any Language  
Ex: Python, Java, C, C++, etc  
Or Any Game Engine (If You Wanted To Go That Route)  
Ex: [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), etc

If You Need Help Installing A Language, Create A [Discussion](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/Game-Dev-Club/discussions) And I Can Try To Help  
Same Goes For A Compiler, Interputer, or IDE

A Good IDE To Start With Would Be [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Updates:

Look For Updates In [Discussions](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/Game-Dev-Club/discussions). 

## Issues

When Making An Issue, Add Some Lables To Your Issue To Better Sort And Understand Them.  
Add Some Description Too, Such As Where It's Happening Or Even Just The Error Would Work.  
Makes It Easier To Help
