If You Need Help Installing A Language, Create A [Discussion](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/Game-Dev-Club/discussions) And I Can Try To Help  
Same Goes For A Compiler, Interputer, or IDE

When Making An Issue, Add Some Lables To Your Issue To Better Sort And Understand Them.  
Add Some Description Too, Such As Where It's Happening Or Even Just The Error Would Work.  
Makes It Easier To Help
