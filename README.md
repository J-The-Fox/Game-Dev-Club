### For Python Projects:
The requirements.txt File Holds A List Of Useful Python Packages That Could be Used In General,

On Windows:
-> cd DriveLetter:/Path/To/requirements.txt
-> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

On Linux / Unix / MacOS:
Externel Drives Should Have The /Volumes Added To The Start For MacOS. 
For Linux / Unix, Use /home/YourUser/DriveName Instead
-> cd /Path/To/requirements.txt 
-> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The setup.py Is Another Python File That Is Helpful To Have But Not Required.
setup.py Holds Information Such As version, aurthor, packages (Folders), description, name, Among Other Things.
You Can Run It Directly Or Run This Command:

On Windows:

For Linux / Unix, Use /home/YourUser/DriveName Instead
-> python3 Path/To/requirements.txt 

### For C++ / C / QT Creator Projects
Make Sure To Include A Makefile File Or CMake File Within The Root Folder Of Your Project, This Will Allow Anyone To Compile Your Project Into An Executable Program

When You Are Ready To Run The Project, (Or Clone It From GitHub), Run The Makefile / Cmake File By Running:

For Makefile
On Windows:
-> cd DriveLetter:/Path/To/Makefile.mk
-> make

On Linux / Unix / MacOS:

For Linux / Unix, Use /home/YourUser/DriveName Instead
-> cd /Path/To/NameOfCmakeFile.cmake
-> cmake





##  Building Files

### C++ / C
You Can Use Makefile To Build And Compile The Scripts
