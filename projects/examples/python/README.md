This Goes Over Some Of The Python Basics As Well As Some Of The Modules I Find To Be Useful

Some Of The Modules Included:

- pygame [Pygame.org](https://www.pygame.org/news), [GitHub](https://github.com/pygame/pygame), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
- psutil [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
- requests [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- kivy [Kivy.org](https://kivy.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/kivy/kivy), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Kivy/)
- Zope [Zope.dev](https://www.zope.dev/), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Zope/)
- colorama [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

> Important Note!: If You Are On Python 3.11.x And Want To Use pygame, You Have To Install The Dev Version!  
> 'python3 -m pip install pygame==2.1.3.dev8' Or Whatever Dev Version You Use  
> Will Change If Something Happens
