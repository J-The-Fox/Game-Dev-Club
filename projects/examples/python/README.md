This Goes Over Some Of The Python Basics As Well As Some Of The Modules I Find To Be Useful

## How To Install Modules

Installing Python Modules Is Pretty Simple.  
Run This Command:

> Note: If You Are On MacOS And Have Not Installed The Command Line Developer Tools Yet,  
> You Will Be Asked To Install Them Before You Can Use These Commands.  

> Note: On Linux, If You Do Not Have pip, Install It By Using Your Package Manager With The  
> Package `python3-pip`

```shell
python3 -m pip install <package_name>
```

You Can View All The Currently Installed Packages By Using

```shell
python3 -m pip list
```

To List Outdated Packages Just Add The `--outdated` To Your List Command

```shell
python3 -m pip list --outdated
```

To Update Packages Type In Your Package(s) And Then A `--upgrade`

```shell
python3 -m pip install <package_name(s)> --upgrade
```
